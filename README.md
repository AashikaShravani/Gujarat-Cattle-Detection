Stray Cattle Monitoring 
# Problem 
The issue of stray cattle roaming on the busy roads is very severe in Gujarat this  pose a significant hazard to public safety, causing traffic disruptions and potential accidents.
Surat Municipal Corporation has CCTV camera installed at various public places, These cameras provide video feeds for monitoring and surveillance.

# Solution
Object detection techniques are utilized as part of the solution. Mobile Net-SSD algorithm is applied to identify and track stray cattle in the  CCTV video feeds.
The Detection of cattle is recorded and generated as a bar chart and if the accuracy of cattle detection is above 95% an alert mechanism is triggered. The authorities are notified about the presence of stray cattle through WhatsApp messages. The inclusion of a tracker in the smart belt enables real-time tracking of cattle locations, facilitating prompt retrieval of stray cattle and contributing to enhanced overall animal management .Real-Time Object Detection: Our project uses the Mobile Net-SSD object detection model to perform real-time object detection on video frames. It identifies objects in the camera feed.
